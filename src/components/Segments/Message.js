                                            Manama Group has been operating in the business world for almost 5 decades, being one of the major importers of basic commodities like fertilizer, wheat, cotton yarn, corn, rice, coal, etc. Earlier creations of MDL include iconic buildings such as Rapa Plaza, Plaza A.R, Manama Shandha, Manama Bellebue, Manama M W Heights and many more in the heart of Dhaka city.<br/><br/>
                                            At present, owning a flat in this heavily-crowded country of ours is like a dream, and MDL strives to make this dream come true by providing the perfect balance between sophistication and attention-to-detail in the country’s real estate sector. MDL’s contemporary, elegant designs and structurally sound commercial buildings and residential apartment complexes provide a glimpse of the modern hub that our country is destined to be.<br/><br/>
                                            MDL’s philosophy is to build luxurious, state-of-the-art apartments and commercial buildings in prime locations of Dhaka including Dhanmondi, Banani, Bashundhara, Gulshan and Baridhara. To realize its vision of creating a new brand of lifestyle for the city dwellers by providing a functional and aesthetical living and working space, MDL not only meets the standard of today’s advancing technology, but also exceeds them. MDL intends to raise the minimum standard in construction from “good” to “great” because that is what you deserve, and in aiming to do so, MDL always focuses on you, since you are not only purchasing finished products, but you are also becoming an integral part of the MDL family. MDL’s utmost effort to offer international standard architectural design while keeping the local culture in mind ensures that all of MDL’s designs are a collaboration of local and international culture.<br/><br/>
                                            MDL’s belief in timely delivery and high quality output is backed by supreme quality construction materials and a highly talented group of qualified structural engineers working alongside MDL. Since commencement, uninterrupted flow of fund is one of the most critical elements towards completion of projects on time, MDL does not rely on the sales of projects to construct the building, rather finances them from own sources of funds.<br/><br/>
                                            The management of MDL promises that your relationship with MDL shall be a mutually beneficial one, and MDL’s doors shall always be open to you for providing seamless quality service whenever required. It is MDL’s motto to present to you ‘’ a touch of your dreams’’.<br/><br/>
